<h2>Call for Speakers</h2>

<p>We invite the CouchDB community to submit talks for the upcoming CouchDB Conf Berlin (January 25&thinsp;–&thinsp;27, 2013). This call for speakers <strong>closes on December 10th, 2012</strong>.</p>

<h3>Topics</h3>

<p>We are interested in talks about the whole spectrum of CouchDB:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting started with CouchDB and related technologies</li>
<li>Advanced CouchDB features</li>
<li>CouchDB operation</li>
<li>Developing apps with CouchDB (web, mobile, you name it)</li>
<li>CouchDB in practice. Your experiences with CouchDB</li>
<li>BigCouch</li>
<li>PouchDB</li>
<li>TouchDB</li>
<li>GeoCouch</li>
<li>CouchDB internals</li>
</ul><h3>We Can Help</h3>

<p>Not everyone is a natural talent on stage. Not everyone can produce kick-ass slide decks. Not everyone is a live-demo-god. Not everyone knows they have something great to talk about.</p>

<p>There are about a million reasons why you don’t consider yourself a speaker. We are here to prove you wrong. If all you have is a gut feeling that you should be on stage, we're here to reach out and help you to develop or hone the skills you think you lack to deliver a great presentation.</p>

<ul>
<li>We are happy to brainstorm your interests to see if a great topic is hiding.</li>
<li>We are happy to connect you with experienced speakers to help prepare your submission.</li>
<li>We are happy to review and advise on how to produce a slide deck. If you don’t feel creative, just use a default Keynote or PowerPoint template.</li>
<li>If you need practice giving talks, get in touch; we can hook you up with local groups or set up a stage and gather a bunch of listeners for you in advance, so you can practice in front of a friendly crowd.</li>
<li>Again, whatever else you might need, we’re here to help.</li>
</ul><p>Get in touch: <a href="mailto:jan@apache.org">jan@apache.org</a> (just don’t use this to submit a proposal).</p>

<p>If you need more encouragement, check out Tiffany Conroy’s excellent site, <a href="http://weareallaweso.me/">We Are All Awesome</a>, providing a push to convince you to speak.</p>

<h3>The Perks</h3>

<p>CouchDB Conf Berlin is a low-budget community event. We can offer:</p>

<ul>
<li>An excuse to go to Berlin (yay!)</li>
<li>Helping out the CouchDB community</li>
<li>An excuse to give a talk</li>
<li>A friendly audience</li>
<li>A chance to meet fellow CouchDB enthusiasts</li>
<li>Having a great time</li>
</ul><p>If your talk gets accepted and you have absolutely no means of getting to Berlin, please get in touch. We have a small budget and supporters who might be able to help. If you can convince your employer to pay for your travels, we are happy to list them as a supporting sponsor.</p>

<h3>The Selection Process</h3>

<p>The selection will be completely arbitrary, based on the whims of the organisers. We want to make sure to create a balanced conference day.</p>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<p>Submit your talk by December 10th, 2012, 23:59:59 CEST.</p>

<p>All talks are in English and 30 minutes long, including Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>Keep your proposals short: 2-3 paragraphs and a short bit about yourself will do.</p>

<p>We are trying to get a recording setup, either audio or video. You will retain full ownership of your slides and recording and we’d like to ask you to make your materials and recording available under a creative commons (we default to no commercial reuse) or other open-source license.</p>

<h3>Submit Your Talk</h3>
