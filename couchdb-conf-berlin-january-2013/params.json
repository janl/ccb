This Call for Speakers **closes on December 10th, 2012**.\r\n\r\n### Topics\r\n\r\nWe are interested in talks about the whole spectrum of CouchDB:\r\n\r\n - Getting Started with CouchDB and Related Technologies\r\n - Advanced CouchDB Features\r\n - CouchDB Operation\r\n - Developing Apps with CouchDB (web, mobile, you name it)\r\n - CouchDB in Practice. Your experiences with CouchDB\r\n - BigCouch\r\n - PouchDB\r\n - TouchDB\r\n - GeoCouch\r\n - CouchDB Internals\r\n\r\n\r\n### We Can Help\r\n\r\nNot everybody is a natural talent on stage. Not everybody can produce kick-ass slide-decks. Not everybody is a live-demo-god. Not everybody knows they have something great to talk about.\r\n\r\nThere are about a million reasons why you don’t consider yourself a speaker. We are here to prove you wrong. If all you have is a gut feeling that you should be on stage, we are here to reach out and help you to develop or hone the skills you think you lack to deliver a great presentation.\r\n\r\n - We are happy to brainstorm your interests to see if a great topic is hiding.\r\n - We are happy to connect you with experienced speakers to help prepare your submission.\r\n - We are happy to review and advise on how to produce a slide deck. If you don’t feel creative, just use our Keynote or PowerPoint templates.\r\n - If you need practice giving talks, get in touch, we can hook you up with local groups or set up a stage for you and a bunch of friends in advance, so you can practice in front of a friendly crowd.\r\n - Again, whatever else you might need, we’re here to help.\r\n\r\nGet in touch: contact@jsconf.eu (just don’t use this to submit a proposal).\r\n\r\nIf you need more encouragement, check out co-organiser Tiffany’s site [We Are All Awesome](http://weareallaweso.me/) that tries to convince you to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Perks\r\n\r\nCouchDB Conf Berlin is a low-budget community event. We can offer:\r\n\r\n - An excuse to go to Berlin (yay!)\r\n - Helping out the CouchDB community\r\n - An excuse to give a talk\r\n - A friendly audience\r\n - Meet fellow CouchDB enthusiasts\r\n - Have a great time\r\n\r\nIf your talk gets accepted and you have absolutely no means of getting to Berlin, please get in touch, we have a small budget and supporters that might be able to help. If you can convince your employer to pay for your travels, we are happy to list them as a supporting sponsor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Selection Process\r\n\r\nThe selection will be completely arbirary, based on the whims of the organisers. We want to make sure to create a balanced conference day.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Guidelines\r\n\r\nSubmit your talk by December 10th, 2012, 23:59:59 CEST.\r\n\r\nAll talks are in English. Talks are 30 minutes long, including Q&A.\r\n\r\nKeep your proposals short, 2-3 paragraphs and a short bit about yourself will do.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to get a recording set up, either audio or video. You will retain full ownership of your slides and recording and we’d like to ask you to make your materials and recording available under a creative commons (we default to no commercial reuse) or other open source license.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Submit Your Talk\r\n\r\nIFRAME\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Venue\r\n\r\nWe are meeting at the lovely Coworking place [Co.Up](http://co-up.de/). They have enough seating for everybody, breakout rooms for hacking, great coffee, fast internet and plenty of tasty food nearby.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Call for Sponsors\r\n\r\nIf you want to Sponsor CouchDB Conf Berlin, please get in touch.\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
